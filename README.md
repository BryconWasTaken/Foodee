This AI project of mine was made for my finals, which I have defended successfully. 

The main idea is to upload a picture of an ingredient, and the app will show recipes which use that given ingredient, 
of which it only knows 13 different types, like:
    potatoes, 
    tomatoes, 
    parsnips,
    beef, 
    pork, 
    chicken, 
    onion, 
    red cabbages, 
    carrots, 
    cucumbers, 
    eggs, 
    leeks, 
    eggplants.

In its database, there are also 13 recipes stored, from which the program sorts out the ones that contain the given ingredient. 

I have made this project to test and study Machine Learning according to my own interests.
